This data set is a subset of 300 cells from the data set described below. The data can be downloaded from Allen Institute Cell Types Database: http://celltypes.brain-map.org/download.

Mouse dorsal LGN Cell Types study 
=================================

rnaseq_profile_id

RNA sequencing data of single cells isolated from mouse dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus.

The data set includes 1772 single cells collected from dLGN in adult mouse and transcriptionally profiled with RNA sequencing. Additional donor meta-data and broad and subclass labels are available for each cell.

The sequencing results were aligned and aggregated at the gene level using the RSEM algorithm, and FPKM values were calculated.

For more details, please see the Documentation tab in the Cell Types web application.


fpkm_table.csv
	Contains the (row, column) matrix of fpkm values obtained for each (gene, cell).
	The first row contains the unique identifiers of the RNA-seq profiles of the cells (rnaseq_profile_id)
	The first column contains the gene unique identifiers (gene_id)


columns-cells.csv 
	Contains information about the cells profiled with RNA sequencing
